## Proteno Tamil Dataset

This dataset contains 30, 000 sentences for text normalization sampled from English-Tamil parallel corpus (Ramasamy et al., 2012) and Comparable Corpora (Eckart and
Quasthoff, 2013).  There are two Python pickled lists containing tokenized unnormalized sentences (unnorm_list.pkl) and their corresponding tokenized normalizations (norm_list.pkl). First 60% of the data was used for training Proteno and the the models were evaluated on the other 40%.
